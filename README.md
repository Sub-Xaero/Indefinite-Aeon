# Indefinite-Aeon
A small arcade-style game programmed in CPP17 with SFML-2 graphics library. 
Largely an explorative project, but entirely playable. 

## Contributions
Feel free to fork and contribute to the project, all pull requests with be reviewed and considered.

## Issues and Questions
This is an old project that was written as a practical learning exercise in C++, therefore there are no plans for further development. 
I will endeavour to answer any questions and any interesting issues will be dealt with where possible, but there are no known bugs at this stage and I have moved onto other things.
